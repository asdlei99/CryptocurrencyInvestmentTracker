# CryptocurrencyInvestmentTracker
Minimalistic program for tracking the value of your cryptocurrency investments
The program is intended to help keep track of the investments current value without the need to manually calculate it.

Use the programs setup option to input the amount you have invested in cryptocurrencies in total and the amount of each currency that you own. The information is stored in a wallet file making the required effort to use the program minimal.
